# SmartLivingAdvisor
## Summary
This project builds an end-to-end, production-ready pipeline and web app to:
- Aggregate multi-source data (listings, maps/POIs, government stats, user reviews).
- Model rent/buy prices, supply–demand gaps, and seasonal trends.
- Score each city/area with a **Housing Quality Score (0–100)** using affordability, services, safety, crowding/cleanliness, and resident sentiment.
- Detect **informal/unplanned settlements** via geospatial patterns.
- Provide a **smart recommender** personalized to the user’s budget and priorities (e.g., near schools, safety, transit).
- Trigger **alerts** when prices drop or new services appear in tracked areas.
